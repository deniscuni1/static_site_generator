# About Me

I am a third year MSci Physics student at Queen Mary University of London.
Through my degree, I have developed strong analytical thinking skills and the ability to approach complex problems in a structured way.
Alongside my studies, I actively work on programming projects to build practical technical skills.

## Academic Interests

- Theoretical physics
- Mathematical methods in physics
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Computational physics
- Data analysis

## Technical Skills

- Python
- Git and version control
- Linux command line
- Basic web development
- Building tools from first principles

## Long Term Goals

My goal is to combine strong quantitative reasoning from physics with practical software development skills. I am particularly interested in roles that require problem solving, modelling, and analytical thinking.

Physics has trained me to break down difficult problems into smaller logical components. Programming allows me to turn that reasoning into something concrete and usable.
