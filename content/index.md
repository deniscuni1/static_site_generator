Third Year MSci Physics Student at Queen Mary University of London

Welcome to my personal website.

I am a third year Physics student currently completing an integrated MSci degree at Queen Mary University of London. I am particularly interested in mathematical physics, computational modelling, and problem solving through programming.

This website was generated using a static site generator that I built from scratch. The goal of the project was to understand how markdown parsing, templating, and file system traversal work.

## What I Do

- Study physics
- Build programming projects to strengthen problem solving skills
- Explore the intersection between physics and software engineering

## Current Focus

I am currently focused on:

- Deepening my understanding of physics
- Strengthening my Python and Go development skills
- Building technical projects that demonstrate both analytical and software engineering ability
