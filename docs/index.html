I am particularly interested in mathematical physics, computational modelling, and problem solving through programming.</p><p>This website was generated using a static site generator that I built from scratch. The goal of the project was to understand how markdown parsing, templating, and file system traversal work.</p><h2>What I Do</h2><ul><li>Study physics</li><li>Build programming projects to strengthen problem solving skills</li><li>Explore the intersection between physics and software engineering</li></ul><h2>Current Focus</h2><p>I am currently focused on:</p><ul><li>Deepening my understanding of physics</li><li>Strengthening my Python and Go development skills</li><li>Building technical projects that demonstrate both analytical and software engineering ability</li></ul><h2>About me</h2><ul><li><a href="/static_site_generator/blog/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/static_site_generator/blog/projects">Projects</a></li></ul><p>
