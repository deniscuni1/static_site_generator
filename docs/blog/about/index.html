        <div><h1>About Me</h1><p>I am a third year MSci Physics student at Queen Mary University of London.
Through my degree, I have developed strong analytical thinking skills and the ability to approach complex problems in a structured way.
Alongside my studies, I actively work on programming projects to build practical technical skills.</p><h2>Academic Interests</h2><ul><li>Theoretical physics</li><li>Mathematical methods in physics</li><li>Machine Learning</li><li>Deep Learning</li><li>Computational physics</li><li>Data analysis</li></ul><h2>Technical Skills</h2><ul><li>Python</li><li>Git and version control</li><li>Linux command line</li><li>Basic web development</li><li>Building tools from first principles</li></ul><h2>Long Term Goals</h2><p>My goal is to combine strong quantitative reasoning from physics with practical software development skills. I am particularly interested in roles that require problem solving, modelling, and analytical thinking.</p><p>Physics has trained me to break down difficult problems into smaller logical components. Programming allows me to turn that reasoning into something concrete and usable.</p></div>
